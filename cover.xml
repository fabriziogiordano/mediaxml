            <description><![CDATA[Demi Moore has reportedly reunited with her estranged daughter Rumer Willis.<br/>The actress apparently received a phone call from 24-year-old Rumer in late September asking if they could bury the hatchet.<br/>This comes after Rumer&#039;s boyfriend, actor Jayson Blair, put pressure on her to rekindle things with Demi.<br/>â€œJayson has been telling Rumer for ages that she needed to forgive her mom and move on,â€ a friend told the magazine Star. â€œShe finally gave in and made the call.<br/>â€œHe knew that deep down Rumer really missed her mother and wasnâ€™t going to be happy until they made up.â€<br/>The magazine claims a source revealed how the pair met in person following the call from Rumer. The reunion was reportedly tearful and the publication states that things are still strained between the mother-daughter duo.<br/>Rumer&#039;s relationship with her mom started to deteriorate after Demi announced she was splitting from her husband Ashton Kutcher last year.<br/>The close relationship between her daughter and Ashton was apparently at the heart of their disagreements.<br/>It was reported earlier this year that Demi&#039;s other two daughters Tallulah and Scout â€“ who were also fathered by Demiâ€™s ex-husband Bruce Willis - had cut contact with the troubled actress.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Snoop Dogg insists he couldnâ€™t ever stop rapping.<br/>The music star is known for his hip-hop tunes but recently announced he is going in a new direction and has changed his name to Snoop Lion. His new album Reincarnated has more of a reggae feel, but Snoop has promised fans he hasnâ€™t turned his back on his musical roots forever.<br/>â€œTo be or not to be? That is the question. Or as we say - to G or not to G? That is the question. We&#039;ll see. I don&#039;t think I could ever stop,â€ he told ET Online when asked if he will ever release another rap album. â€œI just think that, right now, this is what feels good to me. I&#039;ve been doing rap ever since I&#039;ve been a rapper. So that&#039;s probably 1978 when I started and it&#039;s 2012... And to be able to take what I learned from rapping and be able to spin it into reggae music is beautiful because there&#039;s a little rap in reggae and there&#039;s a little reggae in rap, so it&#039;s all complementary.â€]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Dr. Kathleen Pryer has named a family of ferns after Lady Gaga.<br/>The scholar is a professor of biology at Duke University and is also the director of the campusâ€™ herbarium.<br/>Dr. Pryer has been conducting research on a specific family of plants for quite some time and has published her findings on these pteridophytes, which include two new varieties, in Systematic Botany.<br/>The academic believes that this strain of vegetation encapsulates Gagaâ€™s flamboyance.<br/>&#034;We study, in particular, a group of ferns called the cheilanthoid ferns, there are about 500 or 600 of them, and many of them tend to be more adapted to living in desert situations, which is unusual for ferns,&#034; Dr. Pryer told MTV News. <br/>&#034;So often, people give names in honor of old white guys that have worked on ferns for a long time, but we didn&#039;t want to do that. And there were so many things about these &#039;Gaga ferns&#039; that we decided to name the new genus after her, to celebrate diversity.&#034;]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Lindsay Lohanâ€™s legal team believes taking out a restraining order against her father would have â€œdisastrousâ€ ramifications.<br/>The Mean Girls actressâ€™ dad Michael showed up at the actressâ€™ Beverly Hills, California home last week amid concerns over her alleged hard-partying.<br/>Police were called to the scene and Michael left the property.<br/>Lindsay is now believed to be seeking a protection order to prevent him from making another attempt, but her aides are against this action.<br/>&#034;Lindsay is being told by her lawyers that it&#039;s a disastrous idea for her to try and get a restraining order against her father, Michael Lohan,â€ a source told Radar Online.<br/>â€œFirst of all, there is no guarantee that a judge would grant a restraining order against Michael. Michael did show up at her house and try and stage an intervention, because he believes that she is in immediate danger because of her alleged drug and alcohol addiction. That is hardly a form of harassment.<br/>&#034;Secondly, if Lindsay were to petition for a restraining order, this story will just keep going, making it a never ending media cycle of stories about the Lohan family drama.&#034;]]></description>

Audiences were thrilled to see the pair finally come together as a happy family with their daughter Emma. <br/>However, David has confessed that scriptwriters considered keeping the romance open-ended, so viewers would be left guessing.<br/>â€œThere was always that question about do we get Ross and Rachel together? At first we thought that [getting them together] seems so expected,â€ he explained in a clip from the Friends Blu-ray set. â€œ[We thought about a] vague, â€˜They are not together but there is hope for the future.â€™ And then we were like, â€˜Screw that! People have waited ten years for this! Letâ€™s give them what they want and letâ€™s do it really well.â€™â€<br/>In the final episodes, Ross begged Rachel to stay in New York City with him after she landed a new job in Paris. Despite initially deciding she wanted to relocate, Rachel changed her mind at the last minute and agreed to give her relationship with Ross another shot.]]></description>
